This is our IT Web Development project for 2022-2023 Semster 2 in FCAIH.
The goal of the project was to make a fully functional flight booking website using HTML, PHP, CSS, Javascript.

We used a MySQL database and called it 'users', please make a new database in phpmyadmin and import users.sql into it,
in the event that users.sql doesn't work, please import the individual tables given in the project files
